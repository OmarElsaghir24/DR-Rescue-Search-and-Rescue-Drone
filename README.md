# DR-Rescue-Search-and-Rescue-Drone
DR Rescue is a system where a drone and a rover work collaboratively to navigate challenging environments. The drone captures aerial images of the area and uses a pathfinding algorithm to identify a safe route. This route is then relayed to the rover, which follows the path to reach and retrieve an object or assist in a rescue, ultimately delivering it to the designated destination.
